//OLD WAY OF DECLARING

//variable with number
var life = 100;

life = life / 10;

//variable with text
var name = 'Name' //Has to use '' for text

var checkout = true; //BOOLEAN

var random; //if you don't declare value, this variable will be undefined

var random1 = null; //null means that the variable has no value

//NEW WAY OF DECLARING
const life = 100; //const doesn't change since it is constant and you cannot redeclare

life = 50; //let allows you to change or redeclare

console.log('Hello World');
